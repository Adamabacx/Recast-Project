        <p>While Instagram can have a negative impact, there are certain steps you can take to mitigate these effects and have a more positive relationship with it:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Personalize your feed to include content that inspires and informs you.</li>
            <li>Limit your screen time to reduce impulsive scrolling, which helps prevent interference with your sleep or overall well-being.</li>
            <li>Prioritize your mental health and seek help when needed, such as therapy or support groups.</li>
            <li>Focus on face-to-face interactions with friends and family instead of relying solely on social media for connection.</li>
            <li>Regularly take breaks from Instagram and all other social media platforms to engage in fulfilling activities like hobbies, exercise, or spending time outdoors.</li>
        </ul>
