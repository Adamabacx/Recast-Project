        <p>While Instagram can have a negative impact, there are certain steps
            you can take to mitigate these effects and have a more positive 
            relationship with it. One option is to personalize your feed with 
            content that inspires and informs you. Another way to reduce Instagram's 
            impact is to limit your screen time and avoid impulsive scrolling 
            so it doesn't interfere with your sleep or overall well-being.
            Another step you may take is to prioritize your mental health and 
            seek help when you need it, such as treatment or support groups.
            You can also focus on in-person connections. Instead of relying 
            solely on social media for connection, prioritize face-to-face
            interactions with friends and family. Regularly taking breaks from 
            Instagram and all other social media platforms. Use this time to
            do things that make you happy and fulfilled, such as hobbies, exercise,
            or spending time outdoors.
