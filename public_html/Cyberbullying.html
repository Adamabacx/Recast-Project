       <h2 class="header2">Cyberbullying</h2>
        <p>Another negative consequence of Instagram is cyberbullying.
            It manifests as harsh comments, direct communications, 
            and the disclosure of private information. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of Instagram's anonymity and accessibility, bullies can easily
            cause emotional harm to victims, leaving them feeling insecure, 
            lonely, and inadequate. Furthermore, cyberbullying changes people's 
            perspective of themselves and others by causing them to absorb hurtful 
            remarks and compare themselves negatively to false ideals.
