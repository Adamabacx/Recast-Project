        <p>
Everyone loves using social media sites. It connects the world and keeps us 
informed about whatâ€™s going on. It's also a great method to pass the time and
occupy yourself. Social media sites have become vital in modern life, changing
the world. Instagram has developed into one of the world's most popular social 
media networks, with billions of active users. Users can upload photos and videos,
respond to postings by liking, commenting, or sharing them, and follow other 
accounts.It has become crucial in shaping our perceptions of the world around us. 
However, beyond the gleaming gloss is a terrible truth. It distorts reality 
by depicting a perfect lifestyle. Instagram perpetuates the fantasy of the ideal
existence, reinforcing limiting ideals of beauty, prosperity, and happiness. 
I'll be discussing how Instagram's promotion of false ideals can harm mental
and physical health as well as other harms of using Instagram while also distorting
one's perspective of reality.
