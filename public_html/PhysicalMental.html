          One of the primary ways Instagram damages mental health is by disseminating inaccurate
beauty standards. The platform is brimming with photos of stunning bodies, 
perfect lifestyles, and ideal travels. These images, frequently combined with 
filters and editing tools, create an idealized version of reality that the average
person cannot reach. 
Continuous exposure to these images can lead to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem,
and even eating disorders as people strive to satisfy unrealistic standards.
Instagram affects physical health by affecting body image. 
The platform contains photos of attractive bodies, which promote unrealistic beauty standards.
Constant comparison to the curated lives of influencers and celebrities can instill feelings of
inadequacy and drive dangerous habits such as extreme diets and excessive exercise in the quest 
for an unreachable ideal.
