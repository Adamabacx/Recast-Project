        <p>Instagram can also distort financial realities, 
            creating a false sense of financial success and fortune.
            Users on the platform display and mock their pricey goods, 
            lavish vacations, and experiences. 
            This conveys the sense that money earnings and things lead to success
            and happiness. People only share their finest experiences and things,
            which demonstrate financial security, but they may be unaware of the 
            financial challenges that exist behind the scenes.
